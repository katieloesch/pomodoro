What is the Pomodoro Technique—and how do you use it?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. The basic steps are:

Choose a single task to focus on.
Set a timer for 25 minutes and work only on your selected task.
After 25 minutes take a five-minute break.
Repeat steps 1-3 four times.
Take a longer break of about 15 to 30 minutes.
Using the Pomodoro method, you break your workday into 25-minute focus periods followed by five-minute breaks. Each of these focus periods plus a break period is called a Pomodoro—after the tomato-shaped timer first used to test the method.

What makes the Pomodoro method effective?
The idea behind the technique is that the timer instills a sense of urgency. Rather than feeling like you have endless time in the workday to get things done and then ultimately squandering those precious work hours on distractions, you know you only have 25 minutes to make as much progress on a task as possible.

The periodic forced breaks help to lessen that frazzled, burnt-out feeling most of us experience toward the end of the day. With this technique, you haven’t spent hours in front of your computer without even realizing it. Instead, that ticking timer reminds you to get up and take a breather.

About Pomodoro Technique
Pomodoro™ Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. This technique use timer to break down works into a set of intervals separated by breaks. Pomodoro technique increases productivity by taking short scheduled breaks regularly.

How to use Pomodoro/ Tomato timers
Decide task to be done set timers to 25 minutes for one "Pomodoro"
Work on task until timer is complete
Take a 5 minutes short break
After four "Pomodoro" take a long break
Repeat to step 1

What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then-university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.

Though Cirillo went on to write a 130-page book about the method, its biggest strength is its simplicity:

Get a to-do list and a timer.

Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.

When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.

Then enjoy a five-minute break.

After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.

The 25-minute work sprints are the core of the method, but a Pomodoro practice also includes three rules for getting the most out of each interval:

Break down complex projects. If a task requires more than four pomodoros, it needs to be divided into smaller, actionable steps. Sticking to this rule will help ensure you make clear progress on your projects.

Small tasks go together. Any tasks that will take less than one Pomodoro should be combined with other simple tasks. For example, "write rent check," "set vet appointment," and "read Pomodoro article" could go together in one session.

Once a pomodoro is set, it must ring. The pomodoro is an indivisible unit of time and can not be broken, especially not to check incoming emails, team chats, or text messages. Any ideas, tasks, or requests that come up should be noted to return to later. A digital task manager like Todoist is a great place for these, but pen and paper will do, too.

In the event of an unavoidable disruption, take your five-minute break and start again. Cirillo recommends that you track interruptions (internal or external) as they occur and reflect on how to avoid them in your next session.

The rule applies even if you finish your task before the timer goes off. Use the rest of your time for overlearning, or improving skills or scope of knowledge. For example, you could spend the extra time reading up on professional journals or researching networking opportunities.

Todoist Tip

Keep an "Overlearning" project in Todoist with a list of tasks you can quickly choose from the next time you find yourself with pomodoro time to spare.

If the system seems simple, that’s because it is. The Pomodoro technique is all about getting your mind in the zone to finish your tasks.

What makes pomodoro so effective?
The arbitrary silliness of using a tomato as a stand-in for units of time belies the Pomodoro Technique's serious effectiveness in helping people get things done. Here's what makes the method uniquely suited to boosting productivity:

Making it easy to just get started
Research has shown that procrastination has little to do with laziness or lack of self-control. Rather, we put things off to avoid negative feelings. It's uncomfortable to stare down a big task or project - one you may not be sure how to even do or one that involves a lot of uncertainty. So we turn to Twitter or Netflix instead to boost our mood, if only temporarily.

Luckily, studies have also shown an effective way to break out of the avoidance cycle: shrink whatever it is you're putting off down to a tiny, unintimidating first step. For example, instead of sitting down to write a novel, sit down to write for 5 minutes. Still too hard? Try just sitting down to edit a paragraph. Doing something small for a short period of time is a whole lot easier to face than trying to take on a big project all at once.

That procrastination-busting strategy is exactly what the pomodoro technique asks you to do: break down your big tasks, projects, or goals into something you only have to do for the next 25 minutes. It keeps you hyper-focused on the next thing you need to do rather than get overwhelmed by the enormity of what you're taking on. Don't worry about the outcome — just take it one pomodoro at a time.

Combating distractions
If you’ve ever been interrupted when you were in a flow state, you know how difficult regaining focus can be. Yet, the constant stream of information pouring in via emails, team chats, and social media notifications demands more and more of our attention.

While it would be nice to blame technology for everything, recent studies suggest over half of all workday distractions are self-inflicted — meaning we pull ourselves out of focus. In the moment, it can be easy to justify these internal pulls — “This email is too important to wait,” or “It took less than a minute to check my Twitter; it isn’t a real distraction.”

But those small interruptions add up! It isn’t just the time you lose on distractions; it also takes time and energy to refocus your attention. After switching gears, our minds can linger over the previous task for over 20 minutes until we regain full concentration. Indulging the impulse to check Facebook "just for a minute" can turn into 20 minutes of trying to get back on task.

The Pomodoro Technique helps you resist all of those self-interruptions and re-train your brain to focus. Each pomodoro is dedicated to one task, and each break is a chance to reset and bring your attention back to what you should be working on.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task. For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered by “the ticking clock”, especially when it involves a deadline, leads to ineffective work and study habits which in turn lead to procrastination.

The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.

The Goals
The Pomodoro Technique will provide a simple tool/process for improving productivity (your own and that of your team members) which can do the following:

Alleviate anxiety linked to beginning
Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions
Increase awareness of your decisions
Boost motivation and keep it constant
Bolster the determination to achieve your goals
Refine the estimation process, both in qualitative and quantitative terms
Improve your work or study process
Strengthen your resolve to keep on applying yourself in the face of complex situations

At the beginning of each day select the tasks you need to complete and put them on the TODO list above.

Start working:

Start the Pomodoro timer
Work until the Pomodoro rings
Take a short break (3-5 minutes)
Keep on working, Pomodoro after Pomodoro, until the task at hand is finished. Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break, (15–30 minutes).

If a task takes more than 5–7 Pomodoros, break it down
If it takes less than one Pomodoro, add it up, and combine it with another task
Once a Pomodoro begins, it has to ring
The next Pomodoro will go better
Login to the service and track your progress
The Pomodoro Technique shouldn’t be used for activities you do in your free time. Enjoy free time!

What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique sounds too basic to work, but it's surprisingly effective. Here's what you do: You set a timer for 25 minutes, work until it's up, then take a five-minute break—and repeat the whole process three more times. After that, you take a 15- to 30-minute break, depending on how you feel. And that's one full Pomodoro cycle.

I've used the Pomodoro Technique (or variations on it that we'll look at later) for close to 15 years. While it didn't single-handedly get me through my college degrees, it helped me get better grades with less effort. As a professional writer, I use it daily to get work done without dawdling. I'm using it right now to update this article.

What makes the Pomodoro Technique so effective is how easy it is to implement. The work blocks are just 25 minutes long. That's long enough that you can stay engaged and make real progress, without feeling like it's a grind, while the five-minute breaks, which never feel far off, give you a chance to freely check Instagram or look at some emails without overly disrupting your workflow. I'm just four minutes into my current work block, but I know I only have to wait 21 more minutes until my next cup of coffee. Even I can keep typing that long.

But perhaps best of all, because you only have to work for 25 minutes, even when you don't feel like it, you can normally convince yourself to start a timer, do one work session, and see how you get on. By the time you're halfway through that first block, you'll normally have found your groove and be willing to keep going.

Francesco Cirillo developed the Pomodoro Technique in the 1980s when he was in college in Italy and struggling to study. He kept getting distracted and losing focus (and he didn't even have Instagram or TikTok), so he went looking for a way to keep his mind on track. Inspiration came from a small tomato-shaped kitchen timer. Cirillo started by setting it for 10 minutes and trying to just work for the 10 minutes until the timer rang. And it helped—he was instantly more productive, at least when the timer was running.

After a bit of tweaking, testing, and refining, Cirillo settled on 25 minutes of work followed by a five-minute break, repeated four times, as the best balance for him. Since the Italian for tomato is "pomodoro," he called his system the Pomodoro Technique after the original little tomato timer.

Over the past few decades, the technique has become more popular. The basic process is normally described as something like this:

Decide what you're going to do. Pick a task that you think should take roughly 25 minutes to accomplish. Bigger tasks will need to be split into smaller chunks. For example, for me, each section of this article is getting assigned one or two 25-minute chunks, depending on how long it is and how much of the information I need to update.

Set a timer for 25 minutes. Get to work, and don't stop until the timer rings. Ignore any distractions or notifications from emails, texts, or the like. (You should really have everything silenced while you work.)

When the timer rings, you've done one Pomodoro. Take a five-minute break to clear your head. You can stretch, get coffee, or check social media. Basically, any of the things you're not allowed to do when you're working are now fair game. Use the timer to keep yourself honest.

After a total of four Pomodoros, take a longer break. Somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes is normally right; it depends on how you feel. Grab lunch, read a book, or go for a quick walk.

Start another Pomodoro cycle. Keep going until your work or study session is done. Most people will be able to accomplish two full cycles, but three or four are possible if you have a lot to get done.

Marvel at how productive you've been.

I love the Pomodoro Technique. But to be totally honest, I often use longer work blocks once I get into a good flow. Unless you're doing something really intense or really boring, a break every 25 minutes can feel disruptive. But even if you don't stick exactly to the Pomodoro Technique's time blocks, the underlying principles are really powerful—and the same timer apps can generally accommodate longer (or shorter) work blocks.

So, if the formality of the Pomodoro Technique turns you off, don't worry. Cirillo discovered it with trial and error. I suggest you find the time blocks that work best for you the same way.

Add automation to your Pomodoro techniques to spend less time tracking and more time focused on your tasks. Here are ways to use automated workflows for time tracking and task management.

The attention span is the ability to concentrate on a single task, the greater our concentration, the easier it will be for us to do it.
Studies have estimated that this interval lasts approximately 20 minutes.

It is natural to be distracted in search of new information, but it is also possible to focus again by refreshing the attention span. (Study)

What is a Pomodoro Timer?
A Pomodoro timer is a time management tool developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a “Pomodoro”, from the Italian word for ‘tomato’, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The Pomodoro Technique encourages users to take frequent breaks while working, which can help improve focus and productivity. It also helps to reduce procrastination and manage distractions. The technique has been adopted by many people around the world and is now available in various forms, including physical timers, apps, and websites.

How Does it Work?
The Pomodoro Technique follows a simple process: choose a task to be accomplished, set the Pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes), work on the task until the timer rings, then take a short break (3–5 minutes). After four Pomodoros have been completed, take a longer break (15–30 minutes). This cycle can then be repeated as needed.

The idea behind this technique is that frequent breaks can help improve focus and productivity. Taking regular breaks allows your mind to rest and recharge so you can come back to your task with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

Benefits of Using a Pomodoro Timer
Using a Pomodoro timer can help you stay focused on your tasks and increase your productivity. It also helps you manage distractions and procrastination by breaking down large tasks into smaller chunks that are easier to tackle. Additionally, taking regular breaks can help reduce stress levels and improve overall wellbeing.

The Pomodoro Technique is an effective way to manage your time and get more done in less time. It can be used for any type of task or project, from studying for exams to writing reports or completing complex projects.
