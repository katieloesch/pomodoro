Making it easy to just get started
Research has shown that procrastination has little to do with laziness or lack of self-control. Rather, we put things off to avoid negative feelings. It's uncomfortable to stare down a big task or project - one you may not be sure how to even do or one that involves a lot of uncertainty. So we turn to Twitter or Netflix instead to boost our mood, if only temporarily.

If you’ve ever been interrupted when you were in a flow state, you know how difficult regaining focus can be. Yet, the constant stream of information pouring in via emails, team chats, and social media notifications demands more and more of our attention.

While it would be nice to blame technology for everything, recent studies suggest over half of all workday distractions are self-inflicted — meaning we pull ourselves out of focus. In the moment, it can be easy to justify these internal pulls — “This email is too important to wait,” or “It took less than a minute to check my Twitter; it isn’t a real distraction.”

It isn’t just the time you lose on distractions; it also takes time and energy to refocus your attention. After switching gears, our minds can linger over the previous task for over 20 minutes until we regain full concentration.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It was designed to improve productivity and focus by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Steps:

- Select a specific task or set of tasks to work on.

- Minimise disctractions by turning off notifications, closing unnecessary tabs and create a work environment without interruptions.

- Set a timer for 25 minutes, which is referred to as one "Pomodoro". The name Italian name was inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

- Focus solely on the task at hand for the entire 25 minutes. Avoid any distractions, and if something else comes to mind, note it down to handle later.

- When the timer rings, take a short break, for example 5 minutes. This break is meant to recharge and give your mind a rest.

- Repeat the process. Usually, after completing four Pomodoros (i.e. four 25-minute work intervals), it is reconnended to take a longer break, about 15 to 30 minutes. This longer break helps to recharge before starting another set of Pomodoros.

Benefits of the Pomodoro Technique

- Committing to work for only 25 minutes, makes it easier to focus on the task without getting distracted.

- The method helps to structure work in a way that maintains a high level of productivity while avoiding burnout.

- The clear structure also makes it easier to estimate how long tasks take and to plan accordingly.

- The short work intervals make it easier to start tasks and avoid procrastination, as committing to 25 minutes feels more manageable than working for hours on end.

- The regular breaks help maintain mental clarity and energy levels, contributing to a healthier work-life balance.

By incorporating the Pomodoro Technique into your daily routine, you can improve your ability to concentrate, manage your time more effectively, and maintain a sustainable work pace.
Pomodoro technique increases productivity by taking short scheduled breaks regularly.

I built a timer that is customizable and includes a todo list application to set down tasks to complete during each pomodoro.

Cirillo recommends that you track interruptions (internal or external) as they occur and reflect on how to avoid them in your next session.

Todoist Tip

If the system seems simple, that’s because it is.but it's surprisingly effective
What makes the Pomodoro Technique so effective is how easy it is to implement.
The Pomodoro technique is all about getting your mind in the zone to finish your tasks.

Luckily, studies have also shown an effective way to break out of the avoidance cycle: shrink whatever it is you're putting off down to a tiny, unintimidating first step.
break down your big tasks, projects, or goals into something you only have to do for the next 25 minutes. It keeps you hyper-focused on the next thing you need to do rather than get overwhelmed by the enormity of what you're taking on. Don't worry about the outcome — just take it one pomodoro at a time.

The Pomodoro Technique helps you resist self-interruptions and re-train your brain to focus.

The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.

Alleviate anxiety linked to beginning
Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions
Boost motivation and keep it constant
Bolster the determination to achieve your goals
Refine the estimation process, both in qualitative and quantitative terms
Improve your work or study process
Strengthen your resolve to keep on applying yourself in the face of complex situations

If a task takes more than 5–7 Pomodoros, break it down
If it takes less than one Pomodoro, add it up, and combine it with another task

Francesco Cirillo developed the Pomodoro Technique in the 1980s when he was in college in Italy and struggling to study.
Inspiration came from a small tomato-shaped kitchen timer. Cirillo started by setting it for 10 minutes and trying to just work for the 10 minutes until the timer rang. And it helped—he was instantly more productive, at least when the timer was running.

After a bit of tweaking, testing, and refining, Cirillo settled on 25 minutes of work followed by a five-minute break, repeated four times, as the best balance for him. Since the Italian for tomato is "pomodoro," he called his system the Pomodoro Technique after the original little tomato timer.

Over the past few decades, the technique has become more popular. The technique has been adopted by many people around the world and is now available in various forms, including physical timers, apps, and websites.

So, if the formality of the Pomodoro Technique turns you off, don't worry. Cirillo discovered it with trial and error. I suggest you find the time blocks that work best for you the same way.

The idea behind this technique is that frequent breaks can help improve focus and productivity. Taking regular breaks allows your mind to rest and recharge so you can come back to your task with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

Benefits
Using a Pomodoro timer can help you stay focused on your tasks and increase your productivity.

It also helps you manage distractions and procrastination by breaking down large tasks into smaller chunks that are easier to tackle. Additionally, taking regular breaks can help reduce stress levels and improve overall wellbeing.

The Pomodoro Technique is an effective way to manage your time and get more done in less time. It can be used for any type of task or project, from studying for exams to writing reports or completing complex projects.
